# cacti

Collection of scripts and information regarding the installation of cacti version `cacti-0.8.8h`. I use this older version becasue I'm very fond of the weathermap plugin which I believe provides the easiest way to see traffic patterns in your environment. At the time of this document, weathermap is not easily installed with cacti version > 1.0. This may have changed but generally most of the functionality that I like to use is in pre 1.0 versions.
